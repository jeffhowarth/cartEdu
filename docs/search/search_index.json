Basically, it's relevant to any task that involves creating a presentation that combines words and pictures. Theory \u00b6 The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning describes how people mentally process verbal and pictorial information. The theory assumes: working memory has a limited capacity to process information; the processing system involves two separate channels for verbal/auditory and pictorial/visual information; learning is active and involves selecting information, organizing information into mental models, and integrating these models with each other and with previous knowledge. Based on this theory, empirical research by Richard Mayer and his colleagues have identified ten principles for making presentations easier to process. Multimedia principle \u00b6 Present words with pictures, rather than words alone. insert cart example... Coherence principle \u00b6 Just present essential information, don't include extraneous information. insert cart example... Signaling principle \u00b6 Provide cues that highlight the organization of essential material. insert cart example... Segmenting principle \u00b6 Present bite-sized segments that allow learners to control the pace of the presentation. insert cart example...
