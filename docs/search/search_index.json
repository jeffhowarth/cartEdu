It nudged students to reflect on the decisions that they would likely need to make while creating original maps. I listed a set of common problems that tend to come up when people make maps and prompted students to reflect on which of these problems relate to their map and how their work had addressed them.  </p> <p>The handout thus served as a checklist to help students self-evaluate when they were done solving their map design problem, while also serving as a pattern book to help students self-generate a to-do list while they were setting their map design problem. In this way, I hoped to connect cartography to reflective practice and Donald Sch\u00f6n\u2019s seminal book The Reflective Practitioner.     </p> <p>The handout also aimed to push back on a common source of intellectual laziness amongst many but not all students of cartography: the idea that maps are subjective things and, as a consequence, the decisions that a cartographer makes while making maps are arbitrary and a matter of personal preference.  </p> <p>I wanted to help these students get beyond the art of maps to better appreciate the craft of mapmaking. So in addition to describing recurring problems in map design, I tried to briefly describe common solutions to the problems and reasons why these solutions worked.       </p> <p>This site reproduces this old handout and aims to build on it.  </p>"},{"location":"introduction/#structure","title":"Structure","text":"<p>At the moment, the patterns listed on this site loosely follow the pattern template first outlined in 1977 by Christopher Alexander and his colleagues in their seminal book A Pattern Language.  </p> <p>Each pattern includes:  </p> <ul> <li>a short title, </li> <li>a rating, </li> <li>a brief description of a problem or conflict (in bold), </li> <li>and a brief description of a solution.       </li> </ul> <p>In the near future, each pattern will include a visual example or two and, when possible, a link to a tutorial to help people implement the pattern with some tools.  </p>"},{"location":"introduction/#rating","title":"Rating","text":"<p>I use a simple rating system to distinguish the importance of each pattern based on the idea of how often the pattern applies to a map.    </p> <p> Importance Description Applies to all maps; there are few, if any, exceptions.
