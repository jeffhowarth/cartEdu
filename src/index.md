# Patterns for Making Maps 

--- 

Many years ago, I wrote a short handout called: “How will you know when you are done making your map?”

The handout aimed to provide a checklist for undergraduate students in cartography that could help them do two things:    

1. self-evaluate when they finished _solving_ a map design problem;
2. self-generate a to-do list while _setting_ a map design problem. 

This site aims to reproduce the old handout and build on it. 

[Section I](general/introduction.md) describes a sequence of general problems that mapmakers often need to solve while creating an original map. These patterns are relatively abstract and connect to different parts of a workflow.        

[Section II](thematic/patterns-water.md) (will) describe patterns for particular thematic elements depicted on maps. These patterns are more concrete and identify conventions or recurring solutions to map symbolization problems.  

[Section III](examples/reference-topographic.md) (will) organize a set of examples for different types of maps that illustrate many of the patterns described in the book. 

All together, the book aims to support two fundamental laws of mapmaking:

1. A mapmaker must be able to articulate one or more reasons for every decision made on a map.
2. 'I just liked it' should never be the only reason.
