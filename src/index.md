## Introduction  

Ten years ago, I wrote a short handout for undergraduate students called: _"How will you know when you are done making your map?"_ 

The title was a nod to Professor Waldo Tobler, who always asked the root of this question to graduate students at UCSB if the research we proposed did not have clear research questions.     

With the handout, I aimed to help students approach mapmaking as a problem of design. It nudged students to reflect on the decisions that they would likely need to make while creating original maps. I listed a set of common problems that tend to come up when people make maps and prompted students to reflect on which of these problems relate to their map and how they had addressed them.  

The handout thus served as a checklist to help students self-evaluate when they were done _solving_ their map design problem, while also serving as a pattern book to help student self-generate a to-do list while they were _setting_ their map design problem. In this way, I hoped to connect cartography to reflective practice and Donald Sch&ouml;n's seminal book [_The Reflective Practitioner_](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315237473/reflective-practitioner-donald-sch%C3%B6n){target=_blank}.     

The handout also aimed to push back on a common source of intellectual laziness amongst many but not all students of cartography: the idea that maps are subjective things and, as a consequence, the decisions that a cartographer makes while making maps are arbitrary and a matter of personal preference.  

I wanted to help these students get beyond the art of maps to better appreciate the design of maps. So in addition to describing recurring problems in map design, I tried to briefly describe common solutions to the problems and reasons why these solutions worked.       

This site reproduces this old handout and aims to build on it.  

## Structure

At the moment, the patterns listed on this site loosely follow the pattern template first outlined in 1977 by Christopher Alexander and his colleagues in their seminal book [_A Pattern Language_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language){target=_blank}.  

Each pattern includes:  

- a short title, 
- a rating, 
- a brief description of a problem or conflict (in __bold__), 
- and a brief description of a solution.       

In the near future, each pattern will include an example or two that illustrates the pattern and, when possible, a link to a tutorial to help people implement the pattern with some tools.  

## Rating  

I use a simple rating system to distinguish the importance of each pattern based on the idea of how often the pattern apples to a map.

| Importance                    | Description                                                                           |    
| :---                          | :---                                                                                  |
| :star: :star: :star: :star:   | Applies to all maps; there are few, if any, exceptions.                               |
| :star: :star: :star:          | Applies to majority, but not all; there are some exceptions, but not many.            |
| :star: :star:                 | Applies to many, but not majority; for many situations, this pattern will not apply.  |  
| :star:                        | Applies to a few maps; only applies to some specific cases.                       |

## Organization    

I organize the patterns into categories and attempt to order them from general to specific. The general patterns often arise early in a design process and operate at relatively high level of abstraction when you are setting your design problem. The specific patterns often arise a little later in a design process when you work on particular parts of a map or other element. They deal more with the particulars of different types of geographic features that maps often try to show.    

## Revision schedule   

This is a work in progress that I will be working to develop through spring 2023.
